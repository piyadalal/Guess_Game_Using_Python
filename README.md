# Guess_Game_Using_Python
It is a game where user has to guess a number between 1 and 100.The sooner he guesses, the better!!
### **Challenge:** <br>
1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"<br>
2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is<br>
 * within 10 of the number, return "WARM!" <br>
 * further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"<br>
3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is <br>
 * closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"<br>
 * farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"<br>
4. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!
